account abstraction on starknet

## background

StarkNet Alpha 0.10.0 includes native account abstraction implementation. This version introduces changes inspired by EIP-4337.

## quickstart to accounts on starknet

The general workflow is:
1. Account contract is deployed to StarkNet.
2. Signed transactions can now be sent to the Account contract which validates and executes them.

In Python, this would look as follows:
```
from starkware.starknet.testing.starknet import Starknet
from utils import get_contract_class
from signers import MockSigner

signer = MockSigner(123456789987654321)

starknet = await Starknet.empty()

# 1. Deploy Account
account = await starknet.deploy(
    get_contract_class("Account"),
    constructor_calldata=[signer.public_key]
)

# 2. Send transaction through Account
await signer.send_transaction(account, some_contract_address, 'some_function', [some_parameter])
```

### Account entrypoints

Account contracts have only three entry points for all user interactions:

`__validate_declare__` validates the declaration signature prior to the declaration. As of Cairo v0.10.0, contract classes should be declared from an Account contract.

`__validate__` verifies the transaction signature before executing the transaction with `__execute__`.

`__execute__` acts as the state-changing entry point for all user interaction with any contract, including managing the account contract itself. Thatâ€™s why if you want to change the public key controlling the Account, you would send a transaction targeting the very Account contract:
```
await signer.send_transaction(
    account,
    account.contract_address,
    'set_public_key',
    [NEW_KEY]
)
```

## development
